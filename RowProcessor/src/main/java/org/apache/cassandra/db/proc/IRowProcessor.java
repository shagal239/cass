/**
 * Generic interface for data processors, which manipulate data by entire row.
 *
 * One instance of row processor is called from single thread and is used to process rows of single column family store.
 *
 * This processing could happen during:
 * 1. (Major) Compaction. If shouldProcessIncomplete and shouldProcessUnchanged are both false processor is called only when major compacting,
 *    so your processor sees rows with full column set (data currently in memtable is not normally available. You can still get it by yourself 
 *    if you need it)
 * 2. Minor compaction. If shouldProcessIncomplete = false and shouldProcessUnchanged=true processor is also called for all rows, which cassandra can
 *    guarantee it has complete set of columns. Note, that no guarantee is set you will get ALL of complete rows - only majority of them.
 *    This processing implies additional costs, because normally cassandra do not process unchanged rows - it just copies them byte by byte to target sstable.
 * 3. Minor compaction and memtable flush, if shouldProcessIncomplete is set to true. This is the only way to get control when memtable is flushing. Such a processor
 *    will be called even if no warranty can be set on completeness of row's columns passed to {@link IRowProcessor#process(DecoratedKey, ColumnFamily, boolean)} method.
 *    incomplete will be passed true.
 *
 * During processing you can do whatever you want with ColumnFamily - all your changes will be placed to target sstable after you made them. You can signal
 * skipping the whole row over by returning null. Row will not hit target sstable and disappear forever.
